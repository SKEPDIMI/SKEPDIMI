**I'm John**, a software engineer helping teams bring ideas into reality.

**I have worked jobs** for technologies I have learnt in a week, worked with talented remote teams, and helped build platforms from `rails new app`.

**In my work as an engineer** I scope, develop, deploy, and support software systems and products.

**More than writing code**, I create excellent experiences that users love. It's the work that fuels me.
