# Currently tinkering üõ†Ô∏è with... [Ecosy](https://github.com/john-diaz/ecosy)üçÉ!
Some ideas I'm playing around with:
 - A.I.-powered web-platforms. ü§ñ
 - What if there was a website which only had One page for everything? CRUD operations, inviting users, getting suggestions, from just *one* page? Instead of multiple UI forms for editing, there is one single unifyied form- the `MagicForm`, leveraging AI to know exactly what kind of operations the customer is trying to execute.
 - How can the server-side leverage such an interface to do things like "automated" actions on via headless browsers? (example: `NaturalInterface.process({ data: { customer_id: 1, action: "Add items in customer's shopping cart to their Amazon cart" } type: "headless_browser" })`
