**I'm John**, a software engineer helping world-class teams to bring ideas into reality.

**I've been featured in the NY Times**, have gone through the YCombinator batch alongside world-class teams, and helped build enterprise platforms from `rails new app`.

**In my work as an engineer** I scope, develop, deploy, and support software systems and products.

**More than writing code**, I love creating excellent customer experiences and software systems that power the world. It's the work that fuels me.
